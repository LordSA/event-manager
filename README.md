## 📖 Overview

In **CEV (College of Engineering Vadakara)**, information is often scattered across 50+ WhatsApp groups. **Whats @CEV** is a high-performance, AI-driven discovery engine that turns "event data" into "campus intuition."
It’s not just a list of dates. It’s a **multimodal companion** that understands the difference between a formal IEEE seminar and a late-night hostel hack-session.

* **🪄 Glassmorphic UI:** A futuristic, high-performance interface built with **Next.js 15**, optimized for dark-mode lab environments with a sleek blue/purple aesthetic.
* **🏎️ Smooth Motion:** Powered by **Lenis** for that buttery-smooth scrolling experience that feels premium.
* **📱 Mobile-First:** Designed for the student on the move, from the hilltop block to the main gate.
